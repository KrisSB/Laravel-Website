#  <a href="http://142.93.119.73/">Laravel Focused website</a>

This website was my first time using laravel. It focused heavily on a wiki - esque video game based site where the user could create a wiki for a video game and then add tips to the page. After a user added a game or tip, a moderator would have to accept it before it was pushed to the public. The website uses Laravels Gates and Policies to determine if a user has access to do things such as add, edit, or push data.
